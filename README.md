# Deep-Learning-Assignment-1
Assignment 1 of course ELL888, Deep Learning taken by Prof. Prathosh AP.
This assignment comprises the famous BRATS segmentation challenge in which you have to segment a tumour from the scan of a brain image. But in this task we don't have to do the segmentatin but rather the classification of the tumour. We use CNN/DNN and various other neural network techniques to solve the task.
